# Clustering Block Inclusion Delays in the Ethereum 2.0 Medalla Testnet

**Joseph Kholodenko, Gurdal Ertek**

Quote: timeline image.

**Summary:** In this article we provide insights regarding inclusion delay.

## Data Sourcing, Extraction and Preparation
We gather the data based on aggregated slot level data:
- Inclusion Distance Avg
- Inclusion Distance Std Dev
- Attester Slashings
- Voluntary Exits
- Missing Blocks

### Techniques Used and Implementation

We use KMeans as our clustering method along with bar charts, box plots, and 3d visualization of attributes to illustrate heterogeneity among groups. Additionally, we use an approach to non-parametric statistical testing called the <a href="https://scikit-posthocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/scikit_posthocs.posthoc_dunn/>"Dunn test</a> to determine statisical differences between groups.

For voluntary exits and attester slashings, we omit the box plot due to a limited amount of non 0 data. Rather we visualize the non-zero data using 

For the accompanying code for this analysis, <a href="https://blockblockdata.github.io/medalla-data-challenge/a003/code/clustering.html">check out this link.</a>

## Clustering of Slots

We determined the number of k clusters by looking for the maximum <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html">Silhouette score</a>.

After selecting k=9, we looked at the counts of data per cluster. 7 of 9 clusters had 800-1000 points per cluster. 2 clusters had < 40 points per cluster, so we dropped those from the dataset.

## Insights - How do metrics vary across clusters?

### Inclusion Distance Average'
The bar charts provided below presents average inclusion distance for each cluster:

</p>

Next, the box plot shows more information about each cluster (e.g. IQR, outliers).

</p>
The box plot suggests differences across clusters with regards to average inclusion distance. 
We used formal hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of pairwise cluster means.
To this end, we applied the non-parametric Dunn test with Bonferroni correction, which yielded the following results.

In the table, a value of 1 denotes a statistically significant difference in means between that pair of attributes.
