# Clustering Block Inclusion Delay in Ethereum 2.0 Medalla Testnet

## This article is work-in-progress. 
## Please check back on October 19 noon US Eastern Time.

**Joseph Kholodenko, Gurdal Ertek**

**Summary:** We begin this analysis by clustering a dataset based on aggregated epoch data. We used KMeans and chose 8 clusters based on the silhouette score metric.
We then examine the output of the clustering and run the Dunn statistical significance test. We label the output p-vales <= 0.01 as True, else False.
Then we use box plots and bar charts to make the differences more clear.
